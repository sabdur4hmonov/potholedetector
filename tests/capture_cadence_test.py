"""While the car is moving, the app must keep looking at the road.

Taken from a real drive: 45 seconds down a street with at least five potholes produced
5 frames checked, one every 9 seconds, which is exactly STILL_CAPTURE_MS. Every capture
came from the stationary fallback, so the movement gate never fired once and the HUD read
"Holding position" while the road streamed past.

The cause is that a phone can redeliver the same fix, or a coarse one that barely moves.
Staleness was measured from delivery time, so a stuck fix looked perpetually fresh, and
displacement then said the car had not moved.
