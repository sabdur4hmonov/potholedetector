"""Re-analysing a drive's video: the counter, the count, and the speed.

Four bugs this locks down, all reported from real use:
  1. the storage prompt appearing partway through a run
  2. "1 of 2" becoming "2 of 3" as the total grew while the user watched
  3. "0 potholes" on a drive whose live pass had already reported them
  4. frame extraction serialised behind one seeking video element
